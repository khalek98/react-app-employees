# Employees app
My first React CRUD-app<br/>
Link: [https://employees-react-app.herokuapp.com/](Employee App)

This app has these opportunities:
- Create new employee
- Delete employee
- Set a new salary
- Change state "increase (cookies)" and "promotion (star)"
- Sort by "promotion" and "salary more than ... (you can set value would you like)"
